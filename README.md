# About

Kanji-bot is a project started by ANCIENTDOOM for his awesome Discord server filled with weebs that want to learn Japanese.
ANCIENT also happens to be a programmer and in need for an excuse to have a side-project and an excuse to be slacking on his Japanese learning progress so here we are.
Kanji-bot is a bot that 'tries' to learn people some Japanese Kanji and is currently still in an pre-alpha-alpha state.

Bot supports running in multiple servers and persists settings every minute so they aren't lost.
